# UnLiving Digital Portrait
UnLiving Digital Portrait with Raspberry Pi PIR Sensor. You can use every video play with this.
This application runs on the Raspberry pi model 3. I programmed it on Rasbian operation system by using the Python language. 
The digital signal which is transmitted by PIR sensors is perceived via GPIO and triggers Omxplayer.
All descriptions include in code.
Saceam Video is AtmosferFx
In my opinion, it can be utilized at Halloween and people can take the adventage of it at Halloween parties.
